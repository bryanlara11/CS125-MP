Constants Module

This module contains all constant values used throughout the rhythm game.
It defines:
- Game configuration values
- Visual parameters
- Timing constants
- Scoring thresholds
- UI dimensions and positions
- Color definitions

These constants ensure consistency across the game and make it
easier to modify game parameters in one central location.
